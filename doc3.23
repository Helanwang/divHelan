Everything is great.

Problems: example

1.

W4.Num	Code	  UniversityLink1	            UniversityLink2	           UniversityLink3
1	   missouri	 UniversityofMissouri_1.txt	   UniversityofMissouri_2.txt

[the label and everything is correct, but it doesn't show the content of the link]

2.

the order of the excel sheet is messed up. it is not the same as the input,
 and not as alphabetical order.

alphabetical order

3.
the format of input of txt is a bit different than wave4 example.
because wave 4 input has the university url. such as this https://www.adelphi.edu/diversity/.

other wave does not have it. it I just input the content directly,
how the Derek know the university and url and content is matching. Tried to ask Derek for this.
could I change the add another column just for clarification.

4.
another problem, sometimes the files names does not match because it used abbreviation,
Arizona State University is "asu", how to avoid the error like this.
