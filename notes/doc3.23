Everything is great.

Problems: example

1.

W4.Num	Code	  UniversityLink1	            UniversityLink2	           UniversityLink3
1	   missouri	 UniversityofMissouri_1.txt	   UniversityofMissouri_2.txt

[the label and everything is correct, but it doesn't show the content of the link]

2.

the order of the excel sheet is messed up. it is not the same as the input,
 and not as alphabetical order.

alphabetical order

3.
the format of input of txt is a bit different than wave4 example.
because wave 4 input has the university url. such as this https://www.adelphi.edu/diversity/.

other wave does not have it. it I just input the content directly,
how the Derek know the university and url and content is matching. Tried to ask Derek for this.
could I change the add another column just for clarification.

4.
another problem, sometimes the files names does not match because it used abbreviation,
Arizona State University is "asu", how to avoid the error like this.

----------------------------------------
4/10/2025

main change:

- ordered the output data that match the input data

- opened the content of the subfolder instead of just copying the name

- fixed the cvs in google sheet, changed the cell size to default,
 so its not super long and wide each cell. (clicked resize the row)

----
next step:

one more thing to verify:

- the content space in google sheet does it matter, does it need to reduce.

- do we need a verify process to make sure the content matched with the school, and each cell.
also is it all the universities.

--------
explaining the error.

byu: it does not have a second link, show Derek the input folder.

msu: second link is missing due to file size(input) is too large.
it has:
39 of 39 pages
Words	22931 of 22931
Characters	153,522 of 153,522

and the google sheet, single cell limit has only 50,000 characters.

When I changed to other input, such as a single line. It will show on the google sheet.
it also shows in python, so the limitation is google sheet in this case.
